            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Here follow certaine common instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>how the stumpe must be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> whereupon you will graffe or plant.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Verie diligent housholder who will plant, should chuse therto a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, to the end that the wild beast chaw not, nor paire the plantes, or if they be yong, wholly eate in peeces; which to auoyd, is needfull to be in a towne or closed orchard, where there be not too much shadowes, wherein be a sweet ground well muckt, tilled and turned.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Euerie plant will haue foure things.</head>
               <p>FIrst moistnesse, so that the seedes or stumpe be moist and greene.</p>
               <p>Secondly a conuenient place, which hath such earth as will lightly be rubbed to pouder, and that the sunne may come to it: for where there is filthy lome▪ a leane ground, or fandie, or drie burnd, or salt ground, there is nothing good to be planted, to haue anie continuance: Neuerthelesse where the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21721:3"/>ground is leane, there you must giue him more dung. In a fat ground not so much. You must take heede, that the ground be not too moist nor to drie. You must not mucke the trees with hogs dung.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A mediate water or nourishing moyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, therfore be those orchards best which are scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated between two waters, for those that are placed by a waterside, remaine still yoong and fruitfull, and haue commonly the barke smoother and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than the others. And those trees are more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than others which are planted in a valley, or in the lower part of a deepe hill: for from those hiis may come to them nourishment and moistnesse, and the ground which is so scituated, is much fruitfull: but he that can not get for his trees such a ground, must with all diligence seeke, if he may bring to his trees a little spring or pond, of which the trees may sometimes finde some reuiuing, and if you may not haue any of those, and haue a garden, who by it self is naught: the trees will grow with thicke rootes, which hindereth the growing of them, and drieth them at length.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The aire is required, which must be agreeable to them, and of complexion to beare, for there be some trees that doe prosper in all aires: to wit, apple and peare, cherrie and plumtrees. Some will haue a cold aire, to wit chesse-nut trees: and some a very warme aire, as the palme and peper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees: therefore they be rare with vs. That plant which hath these foure things shall prosper: and if they want one or more of these foure thinges, they will decay and their prospering perish.</p>

               <head>At what time trees ought to be planted and set.</head>
               <p>ALl kind of trees may be planted, transported, and cut in March, but it is better they be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in October, for then the frost hurteth them not so much as at other times: for learned men say, that in drie townes and warme countries they plant in October or Nouember, and that in moist townes and cold vallies they plan in Februarie or March: in none other time may you plant or graffe. When you will plant or set againe wild stumps, if there be anie thing broken at the roote, cut it off. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie plant must be set two foot one from another, or at the least one foote, especially when they should beare strong fruits: likewise when thou wilt set strong seeds, as nuts, almonds, and peathes. When a man will plant two stumpes, so must they be of two yeare old, except the vine.</p>
               <p>These thinges you must vnderstand of those plants or stumps which are planted with rootes.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>How the stumps and plantes must be prepared and dressed, which you will plant.</head>
               <p>THe plant or sprout you must cut round about, so that you leaue the verie end of it, and put it then into a hole: but if the stumpe be great, cut it cleane off, and then put onely the vndermost part into a hole, long or short as you will: but if you find two stumps growen togither, you may cut the lesser a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And aboue all thinges you must take heede that the sprout growe vpright, and if it will not,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21721:4"/>you must constraine it, and tie it to a sticke.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Here follow certaine instructions how the trees must be kept, and how you must labour them.</head>
               <p>SOme trees wil haue a fat ground, as figge trees and mulberrie trees; and some leane ground, but all trees be in that point equall, that they will haue in the top drie ground, and in the bottome moist earth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2</hi> In haruest you must vncouer the rootes of the trees so deep, that they may partlie be seen, and lay dung vpon them, which dung must be dissolued of raine in the ground, that it may come to the rootes, which mucking giueth good encrease to the rootes.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3</hi> If the ground wherin the trees stand be too sandie, then mixe among it faire and new lome: and if it be too lomie then mixe amongst it sand in place of mucke, the which you must not onely do hard by the tree, but also foure or fiue foote off from it round about the tree, according as the tree is in bignes, or that the rootes are large and great.</p>
               <p>Such diligence giueth to the trees great helpe, for their nourishment and strength is therby renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hereafter you shall vnderstand, wherby to know the fruitfull soile.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4</hi> In the fat ground the stumpes wherupon you will graffe, must bee left long, but in leane ground short.</p>

                  <hi>5</hi> The plants of trees from their youth, till three years must not be cut nor shred, but they may be transported, and if they be too wake you may

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21721:7"/>they are pricked in the stumpe, it is most needfull as shall after appeare. And because there be manie and diuerse waies to graffe and know howe wild stumps and trees are to be made garden trees: we thought it good to set some of them here downe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Diuerse fashions and waies of graffing there be.</head>
               <p>HE that will extraordinarily graffe all manner of trees, he must know that the more one tree is liker another, the better it will prosper.</p>
               <p>The first sort of graffing is, when the sprout is pricked betweene the barke and the wood of the stumpe, which must be done in May, or Aprill, when the barke may easily be loosed from the tree, and is done after this sort.</p>
               <p>First take a stumpe or tree, and cut him off with a sharpe Saw, knife, or such like instrument, where he is smoothest and cleerest, and full of iuice, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the place with the barke of the same tree which was cut off. Afterward tie the stumpe with a peece of barke, and then pricke a hole betweene the barke of the tree with a pricke of bone, elder wood, or iron, so that it cleaue not, and then put in the place of the pricke, the sprout, which you must haue broken off a plaine and euen tree, of a good kinde, and one yeare old, which you shall know by this: eurie branch haue runckled knots like the ioynt of a mans finger, cut it at one side vnder the knot, so that you touch not the heart of the Tree: and at the other side, you must softly lose the barke that the sprout may ioyne verie close to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21721:7"/>stumpe, then pul out the pricke, and take the sprout and turne the green barke to the bark of the stump, so that it may stand streight.</p>
               <p>The sprout may be foure or fiue fingers, or eight at the most, high aboue the stumpe.</p>
               <p>Of this sort of imping, you may set two, three, or more, according to the bignesse of the stump, or as he can beare, prouided alwaies that they stand at the least the length of a finger one from another.</p>
               <p>Afterward tie it fast (with barke) togither, and put ouer it good mucke, and tie oeur it a cloth, that no raine, or aire, may come between it and hurt it. This sort of imping is commonly vsed in stumps, which are great and old trees, whose barke is thick and strong, as apple trees, pear trees, cherrie trees, and willow trees, on which are imped often times apples, also on figge-trees, and chestnut trees.</p>
               <p>Such grafting is also done in high stumps, and braunches, which be great, but they must be well kept from the wind, that it do not breake them.</p>
               <p>After this sort you may graft manie sortes and kindes of peares vpon one tree, but if you bring peares vpon apples, or apples vpon peares stumps, it will not last long, as afore is said.</p>
               <p>The first way of grafting prospereth best, and hath a good continuance, there be many other sorts of grafting, as followeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An other way of grafting is, when the stumps are clouen, and the sprouts afterwards are put in, the which doe as followeth.</head>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21721:8"/>
               <p> Take a young tree which is scant of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a finger, and cut it smooth and euen, and cleaue it in the midst, then take the sprout which you will impe, and cut it three square, and at the one side leaue the bark vncut, and then turne the same bark outward at the slumpe, and tie it fast as I haue taught, that the wind nor raigne hurt him not.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Otherwise.</head>
               <p>When the slumpe is vncoured &amp; cleane burnisht at the soft place, then tie him fast, that he cleaue no further than to the length of your sprout, which you must graffe vpon him, and then leaue the prick in it, then make your sprout pointed like a prick, so that the middle be not touched, then put it into the cleft hauing clensed the hole first with the point of a knife, so that one bark may touch the other, and outward one wood another, to the end the moisture may haue the more easier his course, then pull out the prick, and that which remaines open and bare between the cleft and the sprout, that binde well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where with the barke of the tree, or with hard pressing with a little sād, or with dung of an oxe, or with waxe, or with a linnen cloth washed in waxe, that no raine, wind or woormes may hurt it. This helpeth much to keep the moistnesse in, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the roote, that it cannot break out, but nourisheth the better the new plant: but when the slumps are great they be cleaued after two waies. The first is, that you cut or cleaue the tree with a knife at one side onelie, til vnto the heart, &amp; that you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21721:8"/>graft into it, but one sprout. The other is, that you cleaue it all ouer, and that you prick or graft on euerie side one sprout, or one alone, and leaue the other side without.</p>
               <p>When the stump is but a little bigger, then the sprout must necessarilie be clouen in two, and you must graft but one sprout into it, as is said in the beginning.</p>
               <p>This cleauing may be doone in Februarie, March, and April, then it is good to cut them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be greene, for to keepe them the better, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground, in cold or moist places.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The third way of grafting.</head>
               <p>This sort of grafting is verie subtil, wittie, and readie, and is done as followeth.</p>
               <p>Go to a smooth apple or peare tree, in Aprill, when the trees get liquor, and seeke a braunche which hath greene eies, and see that the same be lesse than your little finger, and teare it from the tree, and where you see that the green sprouts will come off, there cut them off wholie, and clense the middle therof, that the little red at the wood may turne about, and draw it not off, vntill you come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another good peare or apple tree, and seeke there another branch of the same bignesse that the other was, and cut it off, and take from it likewise the red, as farre as you will put them againe, &amp; looke where the braunches ioyne, that they may well fit togither vpon the toppe, and tie the same place gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and well with a litle barke, behind and before, that the water may not hurte them, and in the first
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21721:9"/>yeare it bringeth foorth leaues and braunches, in the second, flowers, which you may breake off, for the sprout is yet too tender, so that it may beare no fruit, and in the third yeare it bringeth flowers and fruit, and by this means you may graft diuers kindes of peares and apples vpon one tree. I haue likewise set such sprouts vpon wilde stumpes, and they haue prospered.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The fourth way of grafting is.</head>
               <p>HOw buddes are transported and bound vpon another tree, like as a plaister is tied to a mans bodie, this sort of grafting is called in Latin <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastrum.</hi> We read of such a sort of grafting which is called in latin <hi>Abducellum,</hi> and it is much like vnto this sort, wherfore we will onelie speak of it, and is done after this sort.</p>
               <p>When you see vpon a great fruitfull bough, a bud which will prosper without doubt, and woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest faine plant it vpon another tree, take a sharpe knife and lift the bark vp two fingers breadth, that the bud be not hurt, then go to another tree, vpon the which you will graft, and cut into a conuenient place, a like hole into the bark, &amp; put the same bud with the barke into it, and tie it with dung or with a clout which hath lien in a dunghill ouer the cut, that it may be kept from the outward domage of weather, &amp; for an especiall nourishment and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the inner iuice: then cut off the braunches round about it, that the mother may the better nourish the new son: within twenty dais after take away the band, so that you see that the strange bud
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21721:9"/>hath prospered and ioined himselfe with the tree. This may be done in March when the bark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth easily from the tree. Also in Aprill. May, and Iune, and yet she prospereth both before and after a time, when you may conueniently find such buds.</p>
               <p>This sort of planting prospereth best in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tree or such like, which is pierced through, and is done after this sort.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The fifth way.</head>

               <p>Some doe take in March a fresh beech-tree, which is of a mans thicknesse, and pearce him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart with maine and great holes and small holes til vnto the lowermost bark, or quite through: then take sprouts or boughes, which be as big and small, that they may fit into the holes: and when you will put them into the Beech stumpe, you must scrape the vppermost barke off, vntil the greene and no further: then the bough must remaine into the beech, the sprouts must stand a foot or somewhat lesse asunder; then keepe your beech stump with the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21721:10"/>sprouts in a fresh ground, and skant a foote deepe, you must first maime the sprouts, that they may not flourish, then the next March ensuing, dig it out with the sprouts, and cut it asunder with a Saw, and euery blocke which is cut off with his branch, you must set in a fresh ground, and so they wil bring forth the fruit the same yeare.</p>

And if so be the turned sprout prosper, you must breake off the other, to the end that the furned sprout doe not perish, which you may trie after this sort: for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it commeth and prospereth, and manie times it is perished and spoyled.</p>

            <head>Worthy remedies and secretes auailing against the stroying of Snailes, Cankerwormes, the long bodied mothes, garden-fleas, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, and moles.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AFricanus</hi> singular among the Greeke writers of husbandrie reporteth, that Garden plants and rootes may well be purged and rid of the harmfull wormes, if their dennes or deepe holes be smoaked, the wind aiding, with the dung of the Cow or Oxe burned.</p>
            <p>That worthy <hi>Plinie</hi> in his first booke of histories writeth, that if the owner or Gardener sprinckleth the pure mother of the oyle Oliue without any salt in it, doth also driue the wormes away, and defend the plants &amp; hearbes from being gnawen of them. And if they shall cleaue to the rootes of the plants, through malice or breeding of the dung, yet this weedeth them cleane away. The plants or hearbs will not after be gnawen or harmed by garden-fleas, if with the naturall remedie, as with the hearbe Rocket, the Gardener shall bestow his beds in many places.</p>
            <p>The Coleworts and all pot hearbs are greatly defended from the gnawing of the garden-fleas, by Radish growing among them. The eagre or sharp vineger doth also preuaile, tempered with the iuice of Henbane, and sprinckled on the garden fleas. To these, the water in which the heads <hi>Nigella Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> shall be steeped for a night, and sprinckled on the plants, as the Greeke <hi>Pamphilus</hi> reporteth, doth like preuaile against the garden fleas.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:21721:30"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Paladius Rutilius</hi> reporteth, that the noisome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or creeping things will not breed of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearbs, if the Gardener shal before the committing to the earth, drie all the seedes in the skinne of the Tortuise, or sowe the hearbe Mint in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the garden, especially among the Coleworts. The bitter Fitch and Rocket (as I afore vttered) bestowed among the Pot hearbs, so that the seeds be sown in the first quarter of the Moone, do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auaile vs. Also the Canker and Palmer worms, which in many places worke great iniurie both to the gardens and vines, may the owner or Gardener driue away with the fig-tree ashes sprinckled on them and the hearbes.</p>
            <p>There be some which sprinckle the plants and hearbes with the lie made of the fig-tree ashes, but it destroys the wormes to strew (as experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) the ashes alone on them.</p>
            <p>There be others which rather will to plant or sow that big Onion, named in Latin <hi>Scilla</hi> or <hi>Squil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> here and there in beds, or hang them in sundry places of the garden.</p>
            <p>Others also will to fixe riuer Creuisses with nailes in many places of the Garden, which if they shall yet withstand or contend with all these reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, then may the Gardener apply to exercise this deuise, in taking the Oxe or cow vrine, and the mother of oile Oliue, which after the well mixing togither, and heating ouer the fire, the same be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about vntill it be hote, and when through cold this mixture shall be sprinckled on the pot hearbs and trees, doth maruellously preualie, as the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Anatolius</hi> of experience reporteth.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:21721:30"/>
            <p> The worthie <hi>Pal'adius Rutilius</hi> reporteth, that if the owner or gardener burne great bundles of the Garlike blades (without heads) dried, through all the allies of the garden, and vnto these the dung of Backes added, that the sauour of the smoke (by the helpe of the wind) may be driuen to many places, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to those where they most abound &amp; swarm, and the gardener shall see so speedie a destruction, as is to be wondered at.</p>
            <p>The worthie <hi>Plinie</hi> of great knowledge repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that these may be driuen from the Pothearbs, if the bitter Fitch seeds be mixed and sowne togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, or to the braunches of trees, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises hanged vp by the hornes in many places, doth like preuaile. These also are letted from cncreasing, yea they in heaps presently gathered are destroyed, as the Greeks report of obseruation, if the garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by taking certain Palmer or Canker-wormes out of the garden next ioyning, shall seeth them in water with Dill, and the same being through cold, shall sprinckle on the hearbes and trees, that the mixture may wet and soke through the nests, euen vnto the yoong ones, cleaning togither, that they may tast therof, will speedely dispatch them. But in this dooing, the gardener must be very warie, and haue an attentiue eye, that none of the mixture fall on his face nor hands.</p>
            <p>Besides these, the owner or gardener may vse this remedie certaine, and easily prepared, if about the bigge armes of trees, or stemmes of the hearbs, he kindle &amp; burne the stronger lime and brimstone togither. Or if the owner make a smoke with the Mushromes, growing vnder the Nut tree, or burn
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21721:31"/>the hoofes of Gotes, or the gumme <hi>Galbanum,</hi> or els make a smoke with the Harts-horne, the winde aiding, by blowing towards them.</p>
            <p>The husbandmen and gardeners in our time, haue found out this easie practise, beeing now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon euery where, which is on this wise, that when these, after showers of raine are cropen into the warme sun, or into places standing against the sun, early in the morning shake either their fruits and leaues; of the pot hearbes, or the boughes of the trees, for these being yet stiffe, through the cold of the night, are procured of the same, the ligher &amp; soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to fal, nor able after to recouer vp again, so that the Palmer woormes thus lying on the ground, are then in a readinesse to be killedof the Gardener.</p>
            <p>If the owner minde to destroy any other cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things noyous to hearbs and trees, (which <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Rutilius</hi> name, both hearb and Leeke wasters) then let him hearken to this inuention and deuise of the Greeke <hi>Dyophanes,</hi> who willeth to purchase the maw of a Wether sheepe new kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the same as yet full of his excremētall filth, which lightly couer with the earth in the same place, where these most haunt in the garden, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two dayes shall the gardener finde there, that the mothes with long bodies, and other creeping things, will be gathered in diuers companies to the place right ouer it, which the owner shall either remooue and carrie further, or dig and burie verie deep in the same place, that they may not after arise and come forth, which when the gardener shall haue exercised the same, but twise or thrise, he shall vtterly extinguish, and quite destroy all the kindes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21721:31"/>of creeping things that annoy and spoile the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den plants.</p>
            <p>The husbandmen in Flanders arme the stocks, and compasse the bigger armes of their trees, with wisps of straw handsomely made and fastned or bound about, by which the Palmer woormes are constrained to creep vp to the tops of the trees, and there staied, so that, (as it were by snares and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines laid) these in the end are driuen away, or thus in their way begun, are speedily or soone after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to turn backe againe. As vnto the remedies of the Snailes particularlie belongeth, these may the gardener likewise chase from the kitching hearbs if he either sprinckle the new mother of the Oyle oliue, or soot of the chimney on the hearbs, as if he bestowed the bitter fitch in beds among them, which also auaileth against other noysome worms, and creeping things, as I afore vttered, that if the gardener would possesse a greene and delectable garden, let him then sprinckle diligētly al the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, beds, and borders of the garden, with the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of water and ponder of Fenny greeke tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither or set vpright in the middle of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the whole bare head without the-flesh, of the vnchast Asse, as I afore wrote.</p>

            <p>THe skilful <hi>Paxanus</hi> hath left in writing, that if the gardener shall make hollow a big nut, or bore a hollow hole into some sound piece of wood beeing narrow, in filling the one or the other with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21721:32"/>Rosine, Pitch, Chaffe, and brimstone, of eache, so much as shall suffice to the filling of the Nut, or hollow hole in the wood, which thus prepared in a readinesse, stop euerie where with diligence, all the goings forth, and breathing holes of the Mole, that by those the fuming smoke in no manner may issue out, yet so handle the matter, that one mouth and hole be onely left open, and the same so large, that well the Nut or vessel kindled within, may be laid within the mouth of it, wherby it may take the wind of the one side, which may so send in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour both of the Rosin and brimstone into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tombe, or resting place of the Mole: by the same practise so workmanly handled, by filling the holes with the smoke, shall the owner or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener either driue quite away all the Moles in the ground or finde them in short time dead.</p>
            <p>There be some that take the white Neesewort, or the rinde of <hi>Cynocrambes</hi> beaten and farced, and with Barlie meale and Egs finely tempered together, they make both Cakes and Pasties wrought with wine and milke, and those they lay within the Moles denne, or hole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus</hi> of worthie memorie reporteth, that if the owner or gardener closeth or diligently stoppeth the mouthes of the Moleholes with the Garlike onion, or leeke, it shall either driue the moles away, or kill them, through the strong sauour stinking or breathing into them.</p>
            <p>Many there be, that to driue away these harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Moles, do bring vp yoong Cats in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ground, and make tame Weasels, to the end that either of these through the hunting after them,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21721:32"/>may so driue away this pestiferous annoyance, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught to watch at their straight passages, and mouthes of the holes comming foorth.</p>
            <p>Others there be also which diligently fill and stop vp their holes with the red Okare or Ruddell and iuice of the wilde Cucumber, or sow the seeds of <hi>Palma Christi,</hi> beeing a kinde of <hi>Satyrion,</hi> in beds, through which they will not after cast vp, nor tarrie thereabout.</p>
            <p>But some exercise this easie practise, in taking a liue Móle, and burning the powder of Brimstone about him, beeing in a deepe Earthen pot, through which he is procured to crie, all others in the meane time as they report, are mooued to resort thither.</p>
            <p>There are some besides, which lay silke snares at the mouth of their holes.</p>
            <p>To the simple Husbādmen may this easie prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of no cost suffise, in setting downe into the earth a stiffe rod or greene branch of the elder tree.</p>
